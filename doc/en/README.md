# Spring Batch Plus

Spring Batch Plus provides useful classes available in [Spring Batch](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch). Being originally designed to be served as a repository for the Kotlin DSL, it has been expanded to cover functions useful for Spring Batch.

## User guide

The Kotlin DSL helps you declaratively declare a `Job`, `Step`, and `Flow` by using Kotlinâ€™s [type-safe builders](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html), without using `JobBuilderFactory`, `StepBuilderFactory`, or `FlowBuilder`. `ClearRunIdIncrementer` is a class that can replace the `RunIdIncrementer` of Spring Batch which reuses JobParameters in the previous JobExecution. `DeleteMetadataJob` is a `Job` that deletes old metadata. `ItemStreamReaderProcessorWriter` helps you implement `ItemStreamReader`, `ItemProcessor`, and `ItemStreamWriter` as a single class.
